## Amazon S3 Replication – Features & Important Facts

### What is S3 Replication?

**S3 Replication** is a feature that automatically copies objects from a **source bucket** to a **destination bucket** based on defined rules.

Replication happens **after an object is written**, and it works at the **object level**, not at the bucket level.

---

## Core Replication Features

### 1. Automatic Object Copy
- Newly uploaded objects are replicated automatically
- Works based on **prefix** or **object tags**
- Replication is **asynchronous**, not real-time

---

### 2. Cross-Region & Same-Region Replication
- **CRR (Cross-Region Replication)**  
  Used for disaster recovery, latency reduction, compliance
- **SRR (Same-Region Replication)**  
  Used for data segregation, audit copies, multiple consumers

---

### 3. Version-Aware Replication
- **Versioning is mandatory** on both source and destination buckets
- Each replicated object keeps its **own version ID**
- Delete markers can also be replicated (optional)

---

### 4. IAM-Backed and Secure
- Replication uses an **IAM role**
- S3 assumes this role to replicate objects
- Supports **cross-account replication** with proper trust policies

---

### 5. Fine-Grained Control
Replication rules can be scoped by:
- Object prefix (e.g. `myapp/`)
- Object tags
- Storage class (e.g. replicate to Glacier)

---

## Critical Facts People Often Miss

### ? Replication Is NOT Retroactive (By Default)
- Objects uploaded **before** the rule is created are **NOT replicated**
- Existing objects require **S3 Batch Replication**

This is one of the most common misunderstandings.

---

### ? Replication Is Not Instant
- Replication is **eventually consistent**
- There is no SLA for “instant” replication
- Large files and high volumes increase lag

Do **not** rely on replication for live sync use cases.

---

### ? Replication Does NOT Copy Everything
By default, S3 does **NOT replicate**:
- Bucket policies
- ACLs
- Lifecycle rules
- Encryption settings
- Object ownership settings

Only the **object data and metadata** are replicated.

---

### ? Delete Behavior Is Configurable
- Deletes in source create **delete markers**
- You must explicitly enable:
  - Replication of delete markers
  - Replication of permanent deletes

Otherwise, deletes may **not propagate**.

---

### ? Replication Costs Money
You pay for:
- Replication PUT requests
- Inter-region data transfer (for CRR)
- Storage in the destination bucket

Replication is **not free**, even within the same region.

---

## Common Real-World Use Cases

- Disaster recovery (multi-region copies)
- Compliance & audit data separation
- Artifact distribution (builds, installers, static assets)
- Multi-account architectures
- Analytics pipelines (raw ? processed buckets)

---

## What S3 Replication Is NOT Good For

- Real-time synchronization  
- Database-style mirroring  
- Two-way sync (replication is **one-directional**)  
- Replacing CI/CD pipelines  

---

## Key Mental Model (Remember This)

> **S3 Replication is a rule-driven, asynchronous, object-level copy mechanism — not a file sync tool.**

# S3 Replication with ClickOnce (WPF) – Hands-on Lab

## Objective

Understand and validate **Amazon S3 Replication** by using a real-world scenario:
- Hosting a **WPF ClickOnce application** on S3
- Replicating deployment artifacts automatically to another bucket
- Verifying that application updates propagate correctly via replication

This lab mimics a **simple multi-region / backup / distribution** setup for static application artifacts.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Source S3 Bucket** (public)
  - Hosts ClickOnce deployment (`myapp/`)
- **Destination S3 Bucket** (public)
  - Receives replicated objects
- **WPF Application**
  - Published via ClickOnce
  - Install location points to the source bucket

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Create S3 Buckets
- Created **two S3 buckets (BOTH ARE PUBLIC)**
  - Source bucket
    <img width="1785" height="792" alt="3 source_bucket" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be1874d6-d34c-4ab6-96b3-6c71e41b521b" />
    <img width="1762" height="698" alt="4 source_bucket" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e0abe5c-2073-41e2-bcc7-7446efc98856" />

  - Destination bucket
    <img width="1752" height="735" alt="5 destination-bucket" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23d717fb-b68a-45c4-957d-61c5bb1bfea7" />

- Disabled *Block Public Access*
- Allowed public read access to ClickOnce artifacts

---

### 2. Create and Publish WPF ClickOnce App
- Created a **WPF application**
  <img width="1431" height="893" alt="1 clickonce" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b811c9-0d28-4e64-87a3-9001bdbcb6c0" />

- Configured **ClickOnce publishing**
  <img width="1373" height="622" alt="25 publish-changes" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/384b07d7-15b5-4349-8d81-334339610f96" />

- Set the **Install Location** to:
```
    https://<source-bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com/myapp/
```
  <img width="1002" height="686" alt="2 5 clickonce_url" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af18c4f-606f-4141-b7e0-2d410d1bfb77" />

- Enable auto updates on the click once app, so that everytime the app is opened it checks for updates
  <img width="1000" height="698" alt="2 autoupdates" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cefe6268-616b-4a32-a0bc-41d1dcced2d9" />
- Published the ClickOnce artifacts 
- We will copy the artifacts after we enable the replication
---

### 3. Configure S3 Replication
- Create the replication rule
  <img width="1832" height="786" alt="9 start-replication1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1570d5e-133e-4483-8469-428a25c85803" />
  <img width="1510" height="783" alt="10 replication2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b0bdf8-94f3-4299-a0b5-ce35224a1c40" />

  <img width="1855" height="502" alt="11 replication3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b45d03ab-e1c5-419e-8dd6-3c4dd301fd44" />

- Enabled **versioning** on both buckets
- Created a **replication rule**:
  - Source: all contents
  - Destination: second bucket
- Used an IAM role created automatically by S3 for replication
  <img width="1717" height="580" alt="12 replcation-dest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbdfab87-bc91-4298-9e26-fd23356a332d" />

---

### 4. Verify Replication
- Confirmed ClickOnce artifacts were copied to the destination bucket
- Launched the installer **from the destination bucket**
- Verified the application installs successfully

---

### 5. Update and Re-test
- Made changes to the **XAML UI**
- Republished ClickOnce to the source bucket
- Observed:
  - Updated artifacts replicated automatically
  - Updated UI visible when installing from the destination bucket

---

## Result

- ClickOnce deployment works from **both buckets**  
-  Updates propagate automatically via **S3 Replication**  
-  No manual copy or redeploy needed for the destination bucket  

---

## About S3 Replication (Quick Notes)

- S3 Replication automatically copies objects **after they are uploaded**
- It is **asynchronous** (not real-time)
- Requires:
  - Versioning enabled on both buckets
  - IAM role with replication permissions
- Existing objects are **not replicated automatically** unless explicitly configured
- Common use cases:
  - Cross-region backup
  - Disaster recovery
  - Content distribution
  - Compliance and audit requirements

---

## Key Learnings

- S3 can be used as a **simple application hosting platform**
- ClickOnce works well with static hosting when URLs are stable
- Replication is object-level and event-driven
- This pattern can be extended using:
  - CloudFront in front of S3
  - Cross-account replication
  - Blue/green style artifact buckets

---

## Next Improvements

- Add CloudFront in front of the buckets
- Test cross-region replication
- Automate publishing via CI/CD
- Restrict public access using signed URLs or OAI
